          I avoided the pen and paper for so long  It was the only thing, which would bring you back  And feeling your presence would be so wrong  And the illustration of the only thing I lack  My pen missed and longed for my hand  And my paper was tired and white  But going back to the lost and familiar land  I could not bear for my emotions to be so bright   Iâ€™ve fought for my right to forget  To let go of memories that turned into nothing more  But closure and clarity, I just would not get  And my hands, oh my hands, they were so sore   They were always longing for something  But my head was weary and only wanted to fight  But that something, even you could not bring  Because you were no longer associated with light   Closure, clarity Iâ€™ve learned to let go  Because freedom was too high a price to pay  And forgiveness.

          On Heroes
 As I was growing up  My favorite Super Hero was my Mother  Actually, it was Blossom from powerpuff girls  But it should have been my mother  Because  No one describes heroism better than  The person who pretends she doesnâ€™t want that last piece of cake  Though she is starving  And that cake looks so damn delicious  And I know this feels like something you may have read off Facebook  Maybe because I read it off Facebook myself  Forgive me Mother but  It always baffles me how I can find the perfect poem  To talk about love  In all its different shapes and sizes  Except when it comes to you  It baffles me how I can find the perfect words  In every situation  In every occasion  But no words I find are enough  When it comes to  Describing how heroic you are, mother  Describing how beautiful your smile is, mother  Describing how you are the definition of a blessing, mother  You smile is contagious  It overflows  Every time I see you cry  Because the world is too messed up  Or because someone just died in the movie you were watching  Or because you were watching the news and Lebanon is breaking your heart  g to my room to talk to me and I just wasnâ€™t in a good enough  Everytime I see you cry  I wish  More than anything  That I could be the hero that you are  And chase that sadness away from you  And ruin every little thing that makes you sad  Your resilience is contagious  It overflows  You grew up at a time where it took  Risking your life to go from one town to another  You grew up at a time where it took  Risking your life in order to get your college degree  Yet, you are not angry  Not bitter  You wake up everyday looking for the sunshine  In every ounce of darkness  You wake up everyday as a form of praise  Regarding a life filled with struggle  Yet you still eloquently win the battle  Against the darkness of the world  Your love is contagious  It overflows  Everytime I feel like my life is black and grey  You are red  You are pink and you are radiant  And every shiny color there is  Mother, I apologize for every single time  I was too blind to see  The cape you wear on your shoulder  Every morning after you wake up at 6am  And the halo you wear on your head  Every night after you spend the day  Fighting for goodness  Against evil  Mother, I am sorry that every time they used to ask me  Who my favorite super hero was  I was too blind to say it was my mother.
