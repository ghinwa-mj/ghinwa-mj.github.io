      <p><em>On Heroes</em></p>
<small>
<p style="text-align: center;"> 
As I was growing up <br/>
My favorite Super Hero was my Mother <br/>
Actually, it was Blossom from powerpuff girls <br/>
But it should have been my mother <br/>
Because  <br/>
No one describes heroism better than <br/>
The person who pretends she doesn’t want that last piece of cake <br/>
Though she is starving <br/>
And that cake looks so damn delicious <br/>
And I know this feels like something you may have read off Facebook <br/>
Maybe because I read it off Facebook myself <br/>
Forgive me Mother but <br/>
It always baffles me how I can find the perfect poem <br/>
To talk about love <br/>
In all its different shapes and sizes <br/>
Except when it comes to you  <br/>
It baffles me how I can find the perfect words <br/>
In every situation <br/>
In every occasion <br/>
But no words I find are enough <br/>
When it comes to  <br/>
Describing how heroic you are, mother <br/>
Describing how beautiful your smile is, mother <br/>
Describing how you are the definition of a blessing, mother <br/>
You smile is contagious <br/>
It overflows <br/>
Every time I see you cry <br/>
Because the world is too messed up <br/>
Or because someone just died in the movie you were watching <br/>
Or because you were watching the news and Lebanon is breaking your heart <br/>
g to my room to talk to me and I just wasn’t in a good enough   <br/>
Everytime I see you cry <br/>
I wish <br/>
More than anything <br/>
That I could be the hero that you are <br/>
And chase that sadness away from you <br/>
And ruin every little thing that makes you sad <br/>
Your resilience is contagious <br/>
It overflows <br/>
You grew up at a time where it took <br/>
Risking your life to go from one town to another <br/>
You grew up at a time where it took <br/>
Risking your life in order to get your college degree <br/>
Yet, you are not angry <br/>
Not bitter <br/>
You wake up everyday looking for the sunshine <br/>
In every ounce of darkness <br/>
You wake up everyday as a form of praise <br/>
Regarding a life filled with struggle <br/>
Yet you still eloquently win the battle <br/>
Against the darkness of the world <br/>
Your love is contagious <br/>
It overflows <br/>
Everytime I feel like my life is black and grey <br/>
You are red  <br/>
You are pink and you are radiant  <br/>
And every shiny color there is   <br/>
Mother, I apologize for every single time <br/>
I was too blind to see <br/>
The cape you wear on your shoulder <br/>
Every morning after you wake up at 6am <br/>
And the halo you wear on your head <br/>
Every night after you spend the day <br/>
Fighting for goodness <br/>
Against evil <br/>
Mother, I am sorry that every time they used to ask me <br/>
Who my favorite super hero was <br/>
I was too blind to say it was my mother. <br/>
</p>
