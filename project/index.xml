      <description>&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
I avoided the pen and paper for so long &lt;br/&gt;
It was the only thing, which would bring you back  &lt;br/&gt;
And feeling your presence would be so wrong &lt;br/&gt;
And the illustration of the only thing I lack  &lt;br/&gt;
My pen missed and longed for my hand &lt;br/&gt;
And my paper was tired and white &lt;br/&gt;
But going back to the lost and familiar land  &lt;br/&gt;
I could not bear for my emotions to be so bright &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I’ve fought for my right to forget &lt;br/&gt;
To let go of memories that turned into nothing more &lt;br/&gt;
But closure and clarity, I just would not get &lt;br/&gt;
And my hands, oh my hands, they were so sore &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
They were always longing for something &lt;br/&gt;
But my head was weary and only wanted to fight &lt;br/&gt;
But that something, even you could not bring &lt;br/&gt;
Because you were no longer associated with light &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Closure, clarity I’ve learned to let go  &lt;br/&gt;
Because freedom was too high a price to pay &lt;br/&gt;
And forgiveness. I probably won’t be able to do so  &lt;br/&gt;
But it gets better day-by-day &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And one sunshiny morning &lt;br/&gt;
Alone with my cup of tea &lt;br/&gt;
My pen and paper will start to sing &lt;br/&gt;
Because their poet has come back to be 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seven</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On love &amp;amp; numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
7 can only be divided by 7 and by 1  &lt;br/&gt;
7 can only be controlled by 7 and by 1 &lt;br/&gt;
7 has a heart &lt;br/&gt;
7’s heart can only be touched by 7 and by 1 &lt;br/&gt;
Every number from 0 to 7 &lt;br/&gt;
And from 7 to infinity &lt;br/&gt;
Has a heart &lt;br/&gt;
Which can be touched &lt;br/&gt;
By a different one &lt;br/&gt;
I think we all know who 1 is &lt;br/&gt;
I have a 1 &lt;br/&gt;
You have a 1 &lt;br/&gt;
You probably don’t have a 1  &lt;br/&gt;
But you’re looking for a 1 &lt;br/&gt;
1 is the number that no matter  &lt;br/&gt;
How many numbers you add to the  &lt;br/&gt;
List of numbers you know,  &lt;br/&gt;
That 1 will always stand out &lt;br/&gt;
1 is the number that no matter how much &lt;br/&gt;
The distance increases between you and 1 &lt;br/&gt;
Something will always pull you back to that 1  &lt;br/&gt;
7 has dreams  &lt;br/&gt;
7 hopes to some day become as big as 77 &lt;br/&gt;
Or maybe one day increase exponentially  &lt;br/&gt;
To a number beyond the understanding of mathematical definitions &lt;br/&gt;
To infinity &lt;br/&gt;
But even 77  &lt;br/&gt;
Divided by 11 &lt;br/&gt;
Will go back to 7 &lt;br/&gt;
And 7 only needs 1  &lt;br/&gt;
And 7 only loves 1 &lt;br/&gt;
And although 7 can be divided by 1 &lt;br/&gt;
1 does not make 7 small or not whole &lt;br/&gt;
1 does not change 7 &lt;br/&gt;
But rather &lt;br/&gt;
1 allows 7 to remain 7 &lt;br/&gt;
But a better version of 7 &lt;br/&gt;
And in a world where being prime &lt;br/&gt;
Has become quite odd &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

      <title>Revolution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Women &amp;amp; Revolutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
Let the woman in you roar &lt;br/&gt;
Because for too long, she’s been silenced &lt;br/&gt;
Let the woman in you fight &lt;br/&gt;
Because they expected you to always be frightened &lt;br/&gt;
Let the woman in you scream &lt;br/&gt;
Because your country needs you to fight today &lt;br/&gt;
Let the woman in you glow &lt;br/&gt;
Because without you, this revolution is so grey &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Rise from the ashes because &lt;br/&gt;
For too long, too much has been taken from you &lt;br/&gt;
Rise from the ashes and see &lt;br/&gt;
This land is for me &amp; for you too &lt;br/&gt;
Rise from the ashes and say &lt;br/&gt;
Unity, unity what a beautiful view &lt;br/&gt;
Rise from the ashes and see &lt;br/&gt;
Your hopes will never again be so few &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This revolution is female  &lt;br/&gt;
And our rightful future we will declare &lt;br/&gt;
This revolution is inclusive &lt;br/&gt;
For too long, they’ve made us question our own flair &lt;br/&gt;
This revolution is fearless &lt;br/&gt;
And our leadership, they will have to endure &lt;br/&gt;
This revolution is endless &lt;br/&gt;
That, my determination can assure &lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;</description>

      <title>Mother</title>
      <link>https://ghinwa-mj.github.io/project/mother/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Heroes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
As I was growing up &lt;br/&gt;
My favorite Super Hero was my Mother &lt;br/&gt;
Actually, it was Blossom from powerpuff girls &lt;br/&gt;
But it should have been my mother &lt;br/&gt;
Because  &lt;br/&gt;
No one describes heroism better than &lt;br/&gt;
The person who pretends she doesn’t want that last piece of cake &lt;br/&gt;
Though she is starving &lt;br/&gt;
And that cake looks so damn delicious &lt;br/&gt;
And I know this feels like something you may have read off Facebook &lt;br/&gt;
Maybe because I read it off Facebook myself &lt;br/&gt;
Forgive me Mother but &lt;br/&gt;
It always baffles me how I can find the perfect poem &lt;br/&gt;
To talk about love &lt;br/&gt;
In all its different shapes and sizes &lt;br/&gt;
Except when it comes to you  &lt;br/&gt;
It baffles me how I can find the perfect words &lt;br/&gt;
In every situation &lt;br/&gt;
In every occasion &lt;br/&gt;
But no words I find are enough &lt;br/&gt;
When it comes to  &lt;br/&gt;
Describing how heroic you are, mother &lt;br/&gt;
Describing how beautiful your smile is, mother &lt;br/&gt;
Describing how you are the definition of a blessing, mother &lt;br/&gt;
You smile is contagious &lt;br/&gt;
It overflows &lt;br/&gt;
Every time I see you cry &lt;br/&gt;
Because the world is too messed up &lt;br/&gt;
Or because someone just died in the movie you were watching &lt;br/&gt;
Or because you were watching the news and Lebanon is breaking your heart &lt;br/&gt;
g to my room to talk to me and I just wasn’t in a good enough   &lt;br/&gt;
Everytime I see you cry &lt;br/&gt;
I wish &lt;br/&gt;
More than anything &lt;br/&gt;
That I could be the hero that you are &lt;br/&gt;
And chase that sadness away from you &lt;br/&gt;
And ruin every little thing that makes you sad &lt;br/&gt;
Your resilience is contagious &lt;br/&gt;
It overflows &lt;br/&gt;
You grew up at a time where it took &lt;br/&gt;
Risking your life to go from one town to another &lt;br/&gt;
You grew up at a time where it took &lt;br/&gt;
Risking your life in order to get your college degree &lt;br/&gt;
Yet, you are not angry &lt;br/&gt;
Not bitter &lt;br/&gt;
You wake up everyday looking for the sunshine &lt;br/&gt;
In every ounce of darkness &lt;br/&gt;
You wake up everyday as a form of praise &lt;br/&gt;
Regarding a life filled with struggle &lt;br/&gt;
Yet you still eloquently win the battle &lt;br/&gt;
Against the darkness of the world &lt;br/&gt;
Your love is contagious &lt;br/&gt;
It overflows &lt;br/&gt;
Everytime I feel like my life is black and grey &lt;br/&gt;
You are red  &lt;br/&gt;
You are pink and you are radiant  &lt;br/&gt;
And every shiny color there is   &lt;br/&gt;
Mother, I apologize for every single time &lt;br/&gt;
I was too blind to see &lt;br/&gt;
The cape you wear on your shoulder &lt;br/&gt;
Every morning after you wake up at 6am &lt;br/&gt;
And the halo you wear on your head &lt;br/&gt;
Every night after you spend the day &lt;br/&gt;
Fighting for goodness &lt;br/&gt;
Against evil &lt;br/&gt;
Mother, I am sorry that every time they used to ask me &lt;br/&gt;
Who my favorite super hero was &lt;br/&gt;
I was too blind to say it was my mother. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
