Conway has been keeping up with the trends to better comprehend how IR 4.0 changes the competitiveness of countries FDI in specific industries and how it impacts the future of Free Zones.  A determinant of success and survival for companies in IR 4.0 is innovation. Thus, companies are looking for locations where an innovative-friendly environment is set up. This impacts the type of talent companies look for. Trends show that the necessity of cheap labour is becoming less important, as high skilled talent is more in demand. Industry 4.0 also make clusters such as Free Zones more attractive locations for companies. This is due to the vast knowledge base in close geographical proximity, the existence of an agglomeration of companies and talent and finally, the potential to provide a more stable, less uncertain environment of trust and cooperation.  Companies will locate in zones that are closely located to regions where highly skilled talent lives or would want to live. Proximity to local academic institutions, partner companies or zones that have partner programs with knowledge based institutions (e.g. for training) tend to be more favourable for potential investors in a IR 4.0 world.\nIn a high-risk world and an era of continuous disruptions, business-friendly regulations and environments can go a long way in managing the risks of innovation. This impact the way companies view incentives. Financial incentives and tax-benefits will still be an important aspect of business decisions, but companies will begin to prioritize locations where R\u0026amp;D spending and investments to keep up with Industry 4.0 trends are supported.  Companies will locate in zones where tax-cuts on R\u0026amp;D spending and credit support for training and talent development s are offered.\nCorporate expansion is already different in IR 4.0. Business frameworks, even within manufacturing companies, are shifting from “product to service mindset”. This results in a “Product Service System” concept, where product-service bundles are offered as solutions for customers. The concept relies on suppliers, customers and other partners becoming part of a networked and interrelated ecosystem. As a result, companies are less inclined to undertake a greenfield investment purely based on costs, while the integration in the local value chain is minimal.  Companies will locate in zones where the ability to build strategic partnerships, collaboration agreements for technology developments and supportive networks are available.\nIndustry 4.0 will change the way we work. The common fear is that machines will be used to replace workers, but many economists project that in fact, machines can be used to better equip and support teams rather than replace them. It is nonetheless clear that Industry 4.0 presents opportunities to change the nature of work in organizations. The use of technology in the workplace will foster greater collaboration and create more innovative, insightful and creative roles for the future. It remains clear that one of the key advantages that humans will always have over machines is empathy and creativity. Technological change makes this even more relevant and not less.  Companies will in free zones that provide collaborative work spaces that are good for innovation and creativity and support the trend of how the nature of work and the requirements of the workplace are changing.\nIR 4.0 will be the main determinant of which sectors remain relevant in the future. In 2018, the World Economic Forum (WEF) projected strong employment growth in sectors such as AI, robotics and blockchain, as well as non-tech positions such as customer service, training and skills development, sales and marketing. Certain industries will grow, others will become irrelevant and new ones will emerge. Companies within different industries evaluate different criteria while internationally expanding.  Services provided by Free Zones must be adapted and uniquely tailored to the industries of the future.\nIR 4.0 is a development that creates both challenges and opportunities for free zones. Those zones that are able to adapt and make the changes necessary will be most successful and reap the benefits of IR 4.0.\n Post found on: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/conway-data-inc-_5-ways-industry-40-will-affect-the-future-activity-6584821740713623552-k1FU\n","date":1586768593,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586768593,"objectID":"fd10ebb1502af59c112d160edc6fd797","permalink":"https://ghinwa-mj.github.io/post/industry4freezones/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T11:03:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/industry4freezones/","section":"post","summary":"Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0), defined by the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes, continuous to revolutionize the way we live, work and do business as well as disrupt industries.","tags":[],"title":"Five Ways Industry 4.0 Will Affect the Future of Free Zones","type":"post"},{"authors":["_Ghinwa Moujaes_"],"categories":[],"content":"On Heroes\n As I was growing up  My favorite Super Hero was my Mother  Actually, it was Blossom from powerpuff girls  But it should have been my mother  Because  No one describes heroism better than  The person who pretends she doesn’t want that last piece of cake  Though she is starving  And that cake looks so damn delicious  And I know this feels like something you may have read off Facebook  Maybe because I read it off Facebook myself  Forgive me Mother but  It always baffles me how I can find the perfect poem  To talk about love  In all its different shapes and sizes  Except when it comes to you  It baffles me how I can find the perfect words  In every situation  In every occasion  But no words I find are enough  When it comes to  Describing how heroic you are, mother  Describing how beautiful your smile is, mother  Describing how you are the definition of a blessing, mother  You smile is contagious  It overflows  Every time I see you cry  Because the world is too messed up  Or because someone just died in the movie you were watching  Or because you were watching the news and Lebanon is breaking your heart  g to my room to talk to me and I just wasn’t in a good enough  Everytime I see you cry  I wish  More than anything  That I could be the hero that you are  And chase that sadness away from you  And ruin every little thing that makes you sad  Your resilience is contagious  It overflows  You grew up at a time where it took  Risking your life to go from one town to another  You grew up at a time where it took  Risking your life in order to get your college degree  Yet, you are not angry  Not bitter  You wake up everyday looking for the sunshine  In every ounce of darkness  You wake up everyday as a form of praise  Regarding a life filled with struggle  Yet you still eloquently win the battle  Against the darkness of the world  Your love is contagious  It overflows  Everytime I feel like my life is black and grey  You are red  You are pink and you are radiant  And every shiny color there is  Mother, I apologize for every single time  I was too blind to see  The cape you wear on your shoulder  Every morning after you wake up at 6am  And the halo you wear on your head  Every night after you spend the day  Fighting for goodness  Against evil  Mother, I am sorry that every time they used to ask me  Who my favorite super hero was  I was too blind to say it was my mother.
