&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
I avoided the pen and paper for so long &lt;br/&gt;
It was the only thing, which would bring you back  &lt;br/&gt;
And feeling your presence would be so wrong &lt;br/&gt;
And the illustration of the only thing I lack  &lt;br/&gt;
My pen missed and longed for my hand &lt;br/&gt;
And my paper was tired and white &lt;br/&gt;
But going back to the lost and familiar land  &lt;br/&gt;
I could not bear for my emotions to be so bright &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I’ve fought for my right to forget &lt;br/&gt;
To let go of memories that turned into nothing more &lt;br/&gt;
But closure and clarity, I just would not get &lt;br/&gt;
And my hands, oh my hands, they were so sore &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
They were always longing for something &lt;br/&gt;
But my head was weary and only wanted to fight &lt;br/&gt;
But that something, even you could not bring &lt;br/&gt;
Because you were no longer associated with light &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Closure, clarity I’ve learned to let go  &lt;br/&gt;
Because freedom was too high a price to pay &lt;br/&gt;
And forgiveness. I probably won’t be able to do so  &lt;br/&gt;
But it gets better day-by-day &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And one sunshiny morning &lt;br/&gt;
Alone with my cup of tea &lt;br/&gt;
My pen and paper will start to sing &lt;br/&gt;
Because their poet has come back to be 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On love &amp;amp; numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
7 can only be divided by 7 and by 1  &lt;br/&gt;
7 can only be controlled by 7 and by 1 &lt;br/&gt;
7 has a heart &lt;br/&gt;
7’s heart can only be touched by 7 and by 1 &lt;br/&gt;
Every number from 0 to 7 &lt;br/&gt;
And from 7 to infinity &lt;br/&gt;
Has a heart &lt;br/&gt;
Which can be touched &lt;br/&gt;
By a different one &lt;br/&gt;
I think we all know who 1 is &lt;br/&gt;
I have a 1 &lt;br/&gt;
You have a 1 &lt;br/&gt;
You probably don’t have a 1  &lt;br/&gt;
But you’re looking for a 1 &lt;br/&gt;
1 is the number that no matter  &lt;br/&gt;
How many numbers you add to the  &lt;br/&gt;
List of numbers you know,  &lt;br/&gt;
That 1 will always stand out &lt;br/&gt;
1 is the number that no matter how much &lt;br/&gt;
The distance increases between you and 1 &lt;br/&gt;
Something will always pull you back to that 1  &lt;br/&gt;
7 has dreams  &lt;br/&gt;
7 hopes to some day become as big as 77 &lt;br/&gt;
Or maybe one day increase exponentially  &lt;br/&gt;
To a number beyond the understanding of mathematical definitions &lt;br/&gt;
To infinity &lt;br/&gt;
But even 77  &lt;br/&gt;
Divided by 11 &lt;br/&gt;
Will go back to 7 &lt;br/&gt;
And 7 only needs 1  &lt;br/&gt;
And 7 only loves 1 &lt;br/&gt;
And although 7 can be divided by 1 &lt;br/&gt;
1 does not make 7 small or not whole &lt;br/&gt;
1 does not change 7 &lt;br/&gt;
But rather &lt;br/&gt;
1 allows 7 to remain 7 &lt;br/&gt;
But a better version of 7 &lt;br/&gt;
And in a world where being prime &lt;br/&gt;
Has become quite odd &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Women &amp;amp; Revolutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
Let the woman in you roar &lt;br/&gt;
Because for too long, she’s been silenced &lt;br/&gt;
Let the woman in you fight &lt;br/&gt;
Because they expected you to always be frightened &lt;br/&gt;
Let the woman in you scream &lt;br/&gt;
Because your country needs you to fight today &lt;br/&gt;
Let the woman in you glow &lt;br/&gt;
Because without you, this revolution is so grey &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Rise from the ashes because &lt;br/&gt;
For too long, too much has been taken from you &lt;br/&gt;
Rise from the ashes and see &lt;br/&gt;
This land is for me &amp; for you too &lt;br/&gt;
Rise from the ashes and say &lt;br/&gt;
Unity, unity what a beautiful view &lt;br/&gt;
Rise from the ashes and see &lt;br/&gt;
Your hopes will never again be so few &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This revolution is female  &lt;br/&gt;
And our rightful future we will declare &lt;br/&gt;
This revolution is inclusive &lt;br/&gt;
For too long, they’ve made us question our own flair &lt;br/&gt;
This revolution is fearless &lt;br/&gt;
And our leadership, they will have to endure &lt;br/&gt;
This revolution is endless &lt;br/&gt;
That, my determination can assure &lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Ways Industry 4.0 Will Affect the Future of Free Zones</title>
      <link>https://ghinwa-mj.github.io/post/industry4freezones/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 11:03:13 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghinwa-mj.github.io/post/industry4freezones/</guid>
      <description>&lt;small&gt;
Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0), defined by the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing
technologies and processes, continuous to revolutionize the way we live, work and do business as well
as disrupt industries. Conway has been keeping up with the trends to better comprehend how IR 4.0
changes the competitiveness of countries FDI in specific industries and how it impacts the future of
Free Zones.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A determinant of success and survival for companies in IR 4.0 is innovation. Thus, companies
are looking for locations where an innovative-friendly environment is set up. This impacts the
type of talent companies look for. Trends show that the necessity of cheap labour is becoming
less important, as high skilled talent is more in demand. Industry 4.0 also make clusters such
as Free Zones more attractive locations for companies. This is due to the vast knowledge base
in close geographical proximity, the existence of an agglomeration of companies and talent
and finally, the potential to provide a more stable, less uncertain environment of trust and
cooperation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies will locate in zones that are closely located to regions where highly skilled talent lives
or would want to live. Proximity to local academic institutions, partner companies or zones that
have partner programs with knowledge based institutions (e.g. for training) tend to be more
favourable for potential investors in a IR 4.0 world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a high-risk world and an era of continuous disruptions, business-friendly regulations and
environments can go a long way in managing the risks of innovation. This impact the way
companies view incentives. Financial incentives and tax-benefits will still be an important
aspect of business decisions, but companies will begin to prioritize locations where R&amp;amp;D
spending and investments to keep up with Industry 4.0 trends are supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies will locate in zones where tax-cuts on R&amp;amp;D spending and credit support for training
and talent development s are offered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate expansion is already different in IR 4.0. Business frameworks, even within
manufacturing companies, are shifting from “product to service mindset”. This results in a
“Product Service System” concept, where product-service bundles are offered as solutions for
customers. The concept relies on suppliers, customers and other partners becoming part of a
networked and interrelated ecosystem. As a result, companies are less inclined to undertake a
greenfield investment purely based on costs, while the integration in the local value chain is
minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies will locate in zones where the ability to build strategic partnerships, collaboration
agreements for technology developments and supportive networks are available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industry 4.0 will change the way we work. The common fear is that machines will be used to
replace workers, but many economists project that in fact, machines can be used to better
equip and support teams rather than replace them. It is nonetheless clear that Industry 4.0
presents opportunities to change the nature of work in organizations. The use of technology in
the workplace will foster greater collaboration and create more innovative, insightful and
creative roles for the future. It remains clear that one of the key advantages that humans will
always have over machines is empathy and creativity. Technological change makes this even
more relevant and not less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies will in free zones that provide collaborative work spaces that are good for innovation
and creativity and support the trend of how the nature of work and the requirements of the
workplace are changing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IR 4.0 will be the main determinant of which sectors remain relevant in the future. In 2018,
the World Economic Forum (WEF) projected strong employment growth in sectors such as
AI, robotics and blockchain, as well as non-tech positions such as customer service, training
and skills development, sales and marketing. Certain industries will grow, others will become
irrelevant and new ones will emerge. Companies within different industries evaluate different
criteria while internationally expanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services provided by Free Zones must be adapted and uniquely tailored to the industries of the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IR 4.0 is a development that creates both challenges and opportunities for free zones. Those zones that
are able to adapt and make the changes necessary will be most successful and reap the benefits of IR
4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

      <title>Mother</title>
      <link>https://ghinwa-mj.github.io/project/mother/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 13:58:25 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghinwa-mj.github.io/project/mother/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Heroes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
As I was growing up &lt;br/&gt;
My favorite Super Hero was my Mother &lt;br/&gt;
Actually, it was Blossom from powerpuff girls &lt;br/&gt;
But it should have been my mother &lt;br/&gt;
Because  &lt;br/&gt;
No one describes heroism better than &lt;br/&gt;
The person who pretends she doesn’t want that last piece of cake &lt;br/&gt;
Though she is starving &lt;br/&gt;
And that cake looks so damn delicious &lt;br/&gt;
And I know this feels like something you may have read off Facebook &lt;br/&gt;
Maybe because I read it off Facebook myself &lt;br/&gt;
Forgive me Mother but &lt;br/&gt;
It always baffles me how I can find the perfect poem &lt;br/&gt;
To talk about love &lt;br/&gt;
In all its different shapes and sizes &lt;br/&gt;
Except when it comes to you  &lt;br/&gt;
It baffles me how I can find the perfect words &lt;br/&gt;
In every situation &lt;br/&gt;
In every occasion &lt;br/&gt;
But no words I find are enough &lt;br/&gt;
When it comes to  &lt;br/&gt;
Describing how heroic you are, mother &lt;br/&gt;
Describing how beautiful your smile is, mother &lt;br/&gt;
Describing how you are the definition of a blessing, mother &lt;br/&gt;
You smile is contagious &lt;br/&gt;
It overflows &lt;br/&gt;
Every time I see you cry &lt;br/&gt;
Because the world is too messed up &lt;br/&gt;
Or because someone just died in the movie you were watching &lt;br/&gt;
Or because you were watching the news and Lebanon is breaking your heart &lt;br/&gt;
g to my room to talk to me and I just wasn’t in a good enough   &lt;br/&gt;
Everytime I see you cry &lt;br/&gt;
I wish &lt;br/&gt;
More than anything &lt;br/&gt;
That I could be the hero that you are &lt;br/&gt;
And chase that sadness away from you &lt;br/&gt;
And ruin every little thing that makes you sad &lt;br/&gt;
Your resilience is contagious &lt;br/&gt;
It overflows &lt;br/&gt;
You grew up at a time where it took &lt;br/&gt;
Risking your life to go from one town to another &lt;br/&gt;
You grew up at a time where it took &lt;br/&gt;
Risking your life in order to get your college degree &lt;br/&gt;
Yet, you are not angry &lt;br/&gt;
Not bitter &lt;br/&gt;
You wake up everyday looking for the sunshine &lt;br/&gt;
In every ounce of darkness &lt;br/&gt;
You wake up everyday as a form of praise &lt;br/&gt;
Regarding a life filled with struggle &lt;br/&gt;
Yet you still eloquently win the battle &lt;br/&gt;
Against the darkness of the world &lt;br/&gt;
Your love is contagious &lt;br/&gt;
It overflows &lt;br/&gt;
Everytime I feel like my life is black and grey &lt;br/&gt;
You are red  &lt;br/&gt;
You are pink and you are radiant  &lt;br/&gt;
And every shiny color there is   &lt;br/&gt;
Mother, I apologize for every single time &lt;br/&gt;
I was too blind to see &lt;br/&gt;
The cape you wear on your shoulder &lt;br/&gt;
Every morning after you wake up at 6am &lt;br/&gt;
And the halo you wear on your head &lt;br/&gt;
Every night after you spend the day &lt;br/&gt;
Fighting for goodness &lt;br/&gt;
Against evil &lt;br/&gt;
Mother, I am sorry that every time they used to ask me &lt;br/&gt;
Who my favorite super hero was &lt;br/&gt;
I was too blind to say it was my mother. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;</description>
